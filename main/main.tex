\section{Introduction}
What are graphs, social graphs. Influence maximization in social networks. Its application in marketing.  \cite{kempe03} has defined models in which network propagation can be studied. 
\cite{domingo01} studied how to find the value of a customer in a network and how to use that to influence other customers.

\subsection{Influence Maximization}
In \cite{kempe03} they have studied models by which influence propagates through social networks. They have discussed two diffusion models \\
Linear Threshold Model (add reference) and Independent Cascade Models(add reference) . Describe the two models briefly. 
The problem of influence maximization which is finding an initial set that will maximizes the profit( target function) is NP-hard . 
Formal definition : it asks for a parameter k, to find a k-nod set of maximum influence. They used approximation with a natural greedy hill-climbing strategy which will guarantee a 63 percent of the optimal solution performance (reference) . For the approximation to work , he target function should be sub-modular, they have proved that for both models the target function is indeed sub-modular.  They have run experiments on co-authorships in physics theory section of arXiv (www.arxiv.org) . The results show that their greedy algorithm performs better that other methods such as random selection, high-degree or central nodes discussed in book Social Network Analysis by S. Wasserman (find reference) \\
\cite{domingo01} discusses the use case of influence maximization in marketing. They first, described how to model a market as a social network. Making each individual user only dependent on its neighbours, the product and the marketing action(Markov random field). Through these a function was devised that calculates the global lift in profit given a marketing action was applied to some users. Starting from an initial configuration, using different optimization algorithms a local maxima for the function can be reached. 
They experimented on a collaborative filtering dataset (MovieLenz) in which users have rated a list of movies. They have first constructed the network using the user rating, by choosing similar users( calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient of users) as neighbours . They have performed experiments on the data set and compared their method with mass marketing and direct marketing. Their method has increased the profit the most.
