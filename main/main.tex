\section{Introduction}
What are graphs, social graphs. Influence maximization in social networks. Its application in marketing.  \cite{kempe03} has defined models in which network propagation can be studied. 
\cite{domingo01} studied how to find the value of a customer in a network and how to use that to influence other customers.

\subsection{Influcence Maximization}
In \cite{kempe03} they have studied models by which influce propogates through social networks. They have discussed two diffusion models \\
Linear Threshold Model (add reference) and Independent Cascade Models(add reference) . Describe the two models briefly. 
The problem of influence maximization which is finding an initial set that will maximizes the profit( target function) is NP-hard . 
Formal definition : it asks for a parameter k, to find a k-nod set of maximum influence. They used approximation with a natural greedu hill-climbing strategy which will guarantee a 63 percent of the optimal solution performance (reference) . For the approximation to work te target function should be submodular, they have proved that for both models the target function is indeed submodular.  They have run experiments on co-authorships in physicas theory section of arXiv (www.arxiv.org) . The results show that their greedy algorithm performs better that other methods such as random selection, high-degree or central nodes discussed in book Social Network Analysis by S. Wasserman (find reference) \\
\cite{domingo01} discusses the use case of influence maximization in marketing. They first, described how to model a market as a social network, then they applied their method to a collaborative filtering data set (reference MovieLenz project) to extract customer values . Explain how the model the market as social network and how they used a collabrative filtering dataset (Neighbours, Marketing action, movie ratings)
