\section{Introduction}




\section{Literature Review}

Let us start by looking at the sections expected to be in a scientific text. Keep in mind that the same expectations go for all kinds of technical writing.

\subsection{Graph}

\subsection{Social Graphs}




\subsection{Influcence Maximization}

The nature of the matter at hand determines how the topic chapters are disposed.

In order to guide the reader, it is a good idea to start each main chapter with a short paragraph 
on what the main topic of the chapter is and how it progresses from one sub-chapter to the next.

Texts with only one sub-chapter, or with more than two chapter levels (main and sub-chapters) are a 
sign of a problem with the disposition of the text. There may be justifiable reasons to use three-level 
headings in some technical documents, but they are an exception to the rule.

\subsection{Big Data and hadoop}

%\pagebreak
\subsection{Use cases reasearch and industry}


So-called mnemonic references are used for referring to sources; they are constructed as described 
in the section on the list of references. The page numbers should be added to the reference if it would 
be too laborious for the reader to find the reference in the source without them. 

References are always placed inside sentences.  This means that e.g. a separate reference at the end of a paragraph would be inappropriate.

The structure of the text must clearly show what the reference relates to.  At the same time, it 
shows how long a piece of the text that the reference relates to.
